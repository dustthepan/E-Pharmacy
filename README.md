PHARM-EC:
An e-commerce platform for pharmaceuticals and off the counter necessities. 

This application was made using npx-CRA.
FireBase was used to handle user authentication and database management. 
Material UI was used through API use of navigation icons. 
Stripe was implemented for user checkout.
All graphic images were customized and designed personally. 

Initially, the inventory for the inventory was a JSON file, but a FireBase script was used so that each item on checkout was assigned a unique ID.
